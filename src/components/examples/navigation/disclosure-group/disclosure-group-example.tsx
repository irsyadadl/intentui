        <DisclosureTrigger>What is a VPS?</DisclosureTrigger>
        <DisclosurePanel>
          A VPS is a Virtual Private Server, which provides dedicated resources on a server shared
          with other users, offering more control and customization than shared hosting.

        <DisclosureTrigger>What is cloud hosting?</DisclosureTrigger>
        <DisclosurePanel>
          Cloud hosting utilizes multiple servers to balance load and maximize uptime. Instead of
          being hosted on a single server, your data and resources are spread across multiple
          servers.

        <DisclosureTrigger>What is shared hosting?</DisclosureTrigger>
        <DisclosurePanel>
          Shared hosting is a type of web hosting where multiple websites share the same server and
          its resources. It's an affordable option, but may have limitations on performance and
          customization.

        <DisclosureTrigger>What is dedicated hosting?</DisclosureTrigger>
        <DisclosurePanel>
          Dedicated hosting means your website is hosted on a single server exclusively reserved for
          your site. This provides maximum performance and customization, but at a higher cost.
